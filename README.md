# Bear's-birthday-card
 This project was made by me for my friend on her birthday hope she likes it (fingers crossedðŸ¤ž) while following the tutorials by Scrimba.
 
# While making the project I learnt the following topics:
 # 1.Align items 
 It aligns the item along the cross axis in a flexbox container and has 3 values (start,end and centre).
 # 2.Flex direction
 We can flip the main axis in the flex box container using this property and can manipulate the rows and coluns according to needs.
 # 3. :hover(pseudo class)
 Psuedo classes are used to define the state of a particular element at that particular frame.
 For example it can be used to:-
 Style an element when a user mouses over it.
 Style visited and unvisited links differently.
 Style an element when it gets focus.
 # 4. Gradients 
 This is the transition of one color to another while providing the beautiful effects(Nature has better gradients in sky).
 # 5. Grouping Selector
 Helps in selecting multiple elements (with comma in between) and can style multiple elements in between the selectors.
